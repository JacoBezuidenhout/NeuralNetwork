# thread.js

Add Java-like multi-threading to node.js applications, without having to write a separate file.

## Usage

Thread.js has one method that you pass a function to. It will then run that function on a separate thread.

    var threadjs = require('thread.js');
    threadjs.runTask(function () {
      for (var i = 0; i < 100000, i++) {
      }

      console.log("Done.");
    });

## How Does it Work?

The runTask method converts the passed-in function into a string. And then, it will spawn a new node.js process, with the function's string as a command-line argument.
